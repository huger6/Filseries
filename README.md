# üé¨ Filseries - Movie & Series Tracker (Work in Progress)

This project is a **web application** with an integrated **database** that allows users to keep track of which movies and TV shows they have already watched.  
It also includes a **recommendation system** based on the user's viewing history and preferences.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This application is still under development.  
Some features require a valid **API key** to work properly.

## üìå About the Project

Originally, this project started as a first attempt to build a **large-scale application with a database**. The initial version was developed with little planning and served as a foundation for experimentation.  
The current repository represents a **reorganized and refactored version**, where the database structure, code organization, and overall architecture are being reworked for scalability and maintainability.
